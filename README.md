# tokenPricing

How It Works

1. Minting/Burning:

The owner (protocol governance or AI agent) mints or burns tokens based on inflation data fetched from the oracle.



2. Dynamic Reserves:

Reserves can be adjusted manually (later replaced with AI-managed contracts).

Transaction fees can be redirected to the treasury.



3. Oracle Integration:

The oracle contract allows updates to the inflation rate (mocked here; can be replaced with Chainlink oracles).
